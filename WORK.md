# STORY control camera using quaternion

https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/30644/how-to-keep-my-quaternion-using-fps-camera-from-tilting-and-messing-up/30669#30669

## DESIGN

alternatively, I could use a direction and then rotate that using axies angles, probably.

Should I use global axis angles, or the camera's local axis angles?

# STORY movement using physics engine

## ACCEPTANCE

I will know this is complete when:

- I can use input to move along a box collider using Rapier

using camera rotation is out of scope

## TODO add a physics mesh

Might be fun to import Green Hill zone from Sonic Adventure 2?
